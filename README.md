# FetchRewards_coding-exercise

### Hi!  Welcome to my take home coding exercise. Here are the instructions of how you could acess the files for each section. 

## First: Review Existing Unstructured Data and Diagram a New Structured Relational Data Model
- **The ER diagram:** Please see the image ER Diagram.png<br/>
- **Construct a Database:** Please include three datasets (receipts.json.gz, users.json.gz, brands.json.gz) under your working directory and run the python file (Coding_Exercise_DatabaseConstruction). After you run the file, the program would create 6 tables(PartItemTable.csv, receiptTable.csv, usersTable.csv, brandTable.csv, categories.csv, scannedItemTable.csv) and a database called fetchrewards.db.<br/>
- **Access the Database directly:** You could also run the python files (Coding_Exercise_SecondPart_writequeries, Coding_Exercise_ThirdPart_dataissues) directly if you include the database fetchrewards.db under your working directory. 

## Second: Write a query that directly answers a predetermined question from a business stakeholder
To check my answers to all the predetermined questions, please run the python files Coding_Exercise_SecondPart_writequeries. Please make sure your working directory include the database fetchrewards.db. 

## Third: Evaluate Data Quality Issues in the Data Provided
To check my answers to all the predetermined questions, please run the python files Coding_Exercise_ThirdPart_dataissues. Please make sure your working directory include the database fetchrewards.db. 

## Fourth: Communicate with Stakeholders
Please see the word document named email.
